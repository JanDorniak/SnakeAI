# SnakeAI
At the beginning of learning process, every model (snake "brain") is initialized randomly. At the end of every generation fitness of every snake is being calculated. N snakes with best fitness automatically go to the new population. Other snakes are created from 2 picked randomly parents (parents with more fitness are more prefered). After mixing genes of parents, every gene of child can mutate with X chance.
